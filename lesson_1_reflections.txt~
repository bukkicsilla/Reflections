reflections about how to use git and github

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It shows the differences in the old and the new files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Debugging can be faster, to work with others can be easier.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area contains the files which will be added, deleted or updated in the repository. Unchanged files dont need to be 
commited to repository. Working directory contains only the current files.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I want to try something new, but I dont know yet whether it will be in the final version.
