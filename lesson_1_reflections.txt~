reflections about how to use git and github

git diff                   working directory staging area
git diff --staged          staging area commit1
git diif id_old id_new     commit_old commit_new  

git branch another
git branch
git checkout another

On branch short-mode
nothing to commit, working directory clean
context switching

git log --graph --oneline master short-mode

git checkout -b new_branch_name = git branch new_branch_name, git checkout new_branch_name

delete: git branch -d bracnh_name

<<<<<<< HEAD
git diff shows the differance between the working directory and staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I want to try something new, but I dont know yet whether it will be in the final version. Context switching

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It has a tree structure. I can see where are the branchings. I have to use the command git log --graph --oneline [some branch names]
